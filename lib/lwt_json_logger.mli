  * Log a progress bar to the HTTP interface. Takes a "task" to identify
  * the specific bar, and an Lwt_stream to push the client pushes width
  * updates (where the width is a percentage (from 0-100).
  * This actually leaks a bit of memory for each progress bar at present,
  * since it uses a fake Lwt_log.Section level to mark the update as a 
  * progress bar. Requires per-log metadata to anything better I think.
